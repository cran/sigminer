## Overview

The goal of **sigminer** is to provide an uniform interface for genomic
variation signature analysis and visualization.

**sigminer** is powered by [NMF](https://github.com/renozao/NMF) package
and [maftools](https://github.com/PoisonAlien/maftools) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sigminer from Github with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ShixiangWang/sigminer")
```
