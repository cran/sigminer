Description: Genomic alterations including single nucleotide substitution,
    copy number alteration, etc. are the major force for cancer
    initialization and development. Due to the specificity of molecular
    lesions caused by genomic alterations, we can generate characteristic
    alteration spectra, called 'signature' (Alexandrov, Ludmil B., et al. (2020) <DOI:10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3>
    & Macintyre, Geoff, et al. (2018) <DOI:10.1038/s41588-018-0179-8>).
    This package helps users to extract, analyze and visualize signatures from genomic alteration records,
    thus providing new insight into cancer study.
