\title{Get Signature Exposure from 'Signature' Object}
\usage{
get_sig_exposure(
  Signature,
  type = c("absolute", "relative"),
  rel_threshold = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Signature}{a \code{Signature} object obtained either from \link{sig_extract} or \link{sig_auto_extract},
or just a raw exposure matrix with column representing samples (patients) and row
representing signatures.}

\item{type}{'absolute' for signature exposure and 'relative' for signature relative exposure.}

\item{rel_threshold}{only used when type is 'relative', relative exposure less
than (\code{<=}) this value will be set to 0 and thus all signature exposures
may not sum to 1. This is similar to this argument in \link{sig_fit}.}
}
\value{
a \code{data.table}
}
\description{
The expected number of mutations (or copy number segment records) with each signature was
determined after a scaling transformation V ~ WH = W'H' where W' = WU' and H' = UH.
The scaling matrix U is a KxK diagnal matrix (K is signature number, U' is the inverse of U)
with the element corresponding to the L1-norm of column vectors of W
(ie. the sum of the elements of the vector). As a result, the k-th row vector of the final
matrix H' represents the absolute exposure (activity) of the k-th process across samples
(e.g., for SBS, the estimated (or expected) number of mutations generated by the k-th process).
Of note, for copy number signatures, only components of feature CN was used for calculating H'.
